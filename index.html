<b>"Bringing the Virtual one step closer to Reality"</b>

A shop that creates holograms and devices that brings your virtual life one step closer to reality!

Two signature devices that define us as a company.

A mirror with a display that can play videos, give make-up advice, show notifications, give you details about trending hairstyles and more!

It comes with a full HD display and a camera to allow you to use our state of the art services.
<br><br>

Our second device is a tableside holographic display that wakes up when you do, and shows notifications and other important information you need to get started with your day. Comes with voice recognition and able to connect to your devices using Bluetooth creating a more personalised experience.

All of our devices connect to each other allowing you to continue using our service from the moment you step out of the bedroom and into the bathroom (or your wardrobe!).
